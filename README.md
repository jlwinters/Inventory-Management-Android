## Project Summary
The goal of this project was to create an inventory tracking/management application for Android mobile devices. Titled Inventorial, my application is designed to address several user needs in terms of inventory management. I began development by including a login process that uses an SQLite database to allow both - existing, and new users to login to the application. In addition to this, Inventorial has a grid layout overview of all inventory items, which displays the item name and quantity on hand. The goal here was to develop a UI that is minimalistic, yet effective. In order to achieve this, adding or modifying items is easy to do, and utilizes a simplified screen aesthetic. The user can tap and hold onto an item to delete it, or tap on a floating action button in the bottom-right portion of the inventory screen in order to add a new item. The item addition screen is kept fairly simple, where it prompts for the item name and quantity. Finally, I have implemented a notification feature that is designed to request SMS permissions on the users' device, and will notify the user if an item quantity is running low.

## Challenges and Author Notes
The design approach that I took while developing this application began with identifying the user needs, and determining how I can implement these into a functional mobile application. A helpful technique that I used early on was developing a conceptual UI, to give a rough idea of how the application might look, and how I might be able to implement certain features based on those design choices. I followed a strict method of testing often, and trying new ideas. I believe that this technique is very important for developing an error-free application, and learning new things. Overall, I am satisfied with my demonstration of my newly found mobile architecture and programming skills. In particular, I believe that the area where I had the most success was with the UI design. I look forward to expanding upon my knowledge in this area and building upon this application in the near future.
